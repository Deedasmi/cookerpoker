# CookerPoker

NL Texas Hold 'em, but with like, slow cookers or smokers or grills or
something.

This repository holds all the crates in the CookerPoker ecosystem.

Crates are of one of three types (whether or not they're denotated as such in
the repo already):

1. Core game logic (what a card is, how betting works, what hands beat other
   hands, etc.)
2. Web server-side/backend (the web server and what it does: user profiles,
   game API, running a game, connections to a DB, etc.)
3. Web client-side/frontend (compiles to WASM, runs in client browsers)

## Deployment layout

The CookerPoker web server is the central authority. It generates all
randomness, hosts games, tells all players what is happening in their game,
hears from players what they choose to do (and forward that on, if legal
action), has sole interaction with the DB, etc.

To support the web server, ......... a database is used, but what kind .....

## Features

In these early stages, consider this section more of a wishlist/todo than an
actual feature list.

### Server

- [ ] Generate a game log (optionally blinded to one player's view) during or
  after a game is played.

### Client

- [ ] Players can be denoated as an admin of a game
- [ ] Admin players can add/remove other admins
- [ ] Admin players can add to/remove from other player's stack (for rebuys and
  to correct mistakes ["we were all supposed to start with 1,000 chips,
Dave!"])
- [ ]

### Core

- [ ] What 5-card hand beats another (calculate once, then just lookup?)

### Unclear fit

- [ ] Randomness generated by all involved parties (all players in game + the
  server), combined, then used for the next hand/entire game.
- [ ] Way to cryptographically verify all player actions were legitimately
  made, server acted correctly, etc.
